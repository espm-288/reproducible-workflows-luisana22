#GOAL: make a reproducible code

rm(list=ls()) 
not actually super clean

setwd("/home/rstudio/workspaces") #if it starts with a slash most likely not portable

setwd generally bad... let it do its thing, "makes code more portable"

50# is server's fault
400 is your fault



## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Render button checks reproducibility by runnning entire code and producing a neat external pdf


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#usethis::use_github_action("render-rmarkdown.yaml")
#you run this once for robots to find and we can delete it to get it out of the way because once we commit it comes along  
```


```{r}
1 + 1
```


You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

mtcars |> ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
